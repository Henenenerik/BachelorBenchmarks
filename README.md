## BachelorBenchmarks

These SMT-LIB files were generated by running [ExpoSE](https://github.com/ExpoSEJS/ExpoSE) on three npm packages and saving the state of Z3 (ExpoSE's constraint solver) immediately preceeding each satisfiability check.

The npm packages were [minimist](https://www.npmjs.com/package/minimist), [validator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/validator) and [semver](https://www.npmjs.com/package/semver). 

To store the state of the Z3 was done using the [`Z3_solver_to_string()`](https://z3prover.github.io/api/html/group__capi.html#gae8610a38a4a6d7389c57995517011035) function. Unfortunately this produced malformed SMT-LIB.

### Alterations

The instances are stored twice, first the pure output from Z3, then in a subfolder called /sanitised/ a modified version of the file is stored where the following modifications have been made:
* The recursive definition of `str.repeat`, `str.whiteLeft` and `str.whiteRight` have been modified to follow the SMT-LIB standard.
* The functions `str.in_re` and `str.to_re` have been adjusted to the correct syntax `str.in.re` and `str.to.re`.
* All occurances of `\` and `|` within identifiers have been removed.
